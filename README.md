# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository explores the concept and relevance of requirement analysis in the software development life cycle.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is a crucial starting point and phase in the software development lifecycle that often involves gathering, analyzing, and defining the requirements of the software product that is being developed. This phase ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and defined understanding of the software products' functions, capabilities as well as the amount of time and money that's required to develop the product.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. All stakeholders will have a clear detailed understanding and expectation of the software as well as the basis of its design.
2. The scope of the software project will be clearly defined, preventing scope creep.
3. It facilitates accurate estimation of the amount of time and money that needs to be invested in the project.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

#### 1. Requirement Gathering 

This involves conducting interviews, surveys, workshops, observation and document analysis. Each of these methods are aimed at gathering information in order to undertstand stakeholder requirements and current system functionalities.

#### 2. Requirement Elicitation 

Requirements can be gathered by brainstorming ideas, engaging focus groups for in-depth input, and using prototypes to help stakeholders visualize and refine their needs.

#### 3. Requirement Documentation 

Requirements are documented through detailed specification documents, user stories describing functionality from the user's viewpoint, and use case diagrams illustrating system-user interactions.

#### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Requirements are evaluated by prioritizing them, analyzing their feasibility, and using models to visualize and better understand them.

#### 5. Requirement Validation

Requirements are validated through stakeholder reviews, defined acceptance criteria, and traceability to ensure completeness and alignment throughout development.

## Types of Requirements.

#### Functional Requirements

The system should allow users to search for properties using filters like location and price, register and log in securely, view property listings with details and images, and manage bookings through a complete booking system.

#### Non-functional Requirements 

The system must perform efficiently with fast load times and support for many users, maintain high security standards, scale with growing demand, offer a user-friendly interface, and ensure high reliability with minimal downtime.
